            <h3 id="p1">RUNES are alphabetical signs at least eighteen centuries old elaborated by ancient European people. 
                These signs used to be employed in peotry, stone carvings and fortune-telling by many ancient tribes, such as, the Germans, the Celts, and the Vikings.
            </h3>
            <h3 id="p2">Although they are an alphabet, the RUNES never became a spoken idiom. Each of its signs is a magical symbol.
                Therefore, the RUNES were assumed to be a ritual language, becoming the voice of an oracle.
            </h3>
            <h3 id="p3">Oracles, however, do not tell the future. Their purpose is to direct people to what is happening inside their minds
                in order to reach the answers from the subconcience.
